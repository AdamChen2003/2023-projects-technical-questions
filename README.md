# 2023-projects-technical-questions

This repo contains all the questions you can elect to do.


DO NOT ATTEMPT ALL QUESTIONS!!!!!!!!!!


This repo collects a bunch of questions, and you should select the questions which best show your strengths. Try to think about which projects you would be interested in, and pick questions relevant to what you want to do in that project (Eg BE, FE, React, state management, etc). We will label the questions with which projects are related to each question.

# 2023 Projects Recruitment Technical Questions

Welcome, and thank you for applying to one of CSESoc Development's flagship projects!
This repository contains all questions for our technical screening.

**YOU DO NOT NEED TO ATTEMPT ALL QUESTIONS!**

There are two baseline questions, one for **frontend** and one for **backend**. Some projects
may also have their own questions, because their tech stack requires specific knowledge
(e.g. the backend for Chaos is written in Rust).

**We do not expect applicants to do all questions.** Please choose questions that you
feel would best reflect the projects you want to join (i.e. if you want to work on
frontend, do the frontend question). At the top of each technical question, there
will be a section that details which projects the question is relevant for.

## Setting up

Some questions will need setup before they can run properly. This should be written
in the `README.md` of each question. If you have any questions, feel free to contact:

- `development@csesoc.org.au` via email
- Hanyuan (hanyuone#0001) or Angella (Angella#2408) on Discord

## Submitting

> TODO once I figure out what `solutions` branch is for

**Good luck, and happy coding!**
